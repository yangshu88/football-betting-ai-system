## What Are Golden Bets?

Golden Bets are the **safest, highest-confidence betting picks** identified by the AI system each day. They represent the top 1-3 opportunities across all analyzed matches and the 4 target markets.

### Key Features

- **85%+ Win Probability:** Only picks with exceptional confidence
- **90%+ Model Agreement:** Multiple AI models must agree
- **1-3 Daily Picks:** Quality over quantity
- **Transparent Reasoning:** Clear explanations for each selection

# Get Smart Bets predictions
predictor = SmartBetsPredictor()
smart_predictions = predictor.predict(matches)

# Get model probabilities
model_probs = predictor.get_model_probabilities(matches)

# Filter for Golden Bets
filter = GoldenBetsFilter()
golden_bets = filter.filter_golden_bets(
    smart_bets_predictions=smart_predictions,
    model_probabilities=model_probs
)

# Display results
for bet in golden_bets:
    print(f"🏆 {bet['home_team']} vs {bet['away_team']}")
    print(f"   {bet['market_name']}: {bet['selection_name']}")
    print(f"   Confidence: {bet['confidence_score']:.1%}")
    print(f"   Golden Score: {bet['golden_score']:.3f}")
```

### 5. API Usage

Start the API server:

```bash
cd user-api
python main.py
```

Make a request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predictions/golden-bets \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "matches": [
      {

        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json

## Understanding the Output

### Golden Score Calculation

```
Golden Score = (0.7 × Probability) + (0.3 × Agreement)
```

**Example:**
- Probability: 87%
- Agreement: 95%
- Golden Score: (0.7 × 0.87) + (0.3 × 0.95) = **0.894**

### Selection Process

1. **Filter by Confidence:** Only predictions ≥85%
2. **Check Agreement:** Only predictions with ≥90% model consensus
3. **Rank by Golden Score:** Sort candidates by composite score
4. **Select Top 1-3:** Return highest-scoring picks

---

## Configuration

Adjust thresholds in `golden-bets-ai/config.py`:

```python
# Stricter filtering (fewer picks, higher confidence)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.90  # 90% minimum
MIN_ENSEMBLE_AGREEMENT = 0.95  # 95% agreement

# More lenient filtering (more picks, lower confidence)
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.80  # 80% minimum
MIN_ENSEMBLE_AGREEMENT = 0.85  # 85% agreement
```

---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: No Golden Bets Found

**Cause:** No predictions meet thresholds  
**Solution:**
```python
# Lower thresholds temporarily
filter = GoldenBetsFilter()
filter.confidence_threshold = 0.80
filter.min_agreement = 0.85
```

### Scenario 2: Too Many Golden Bets

**Cause:** Many high-confidence predictions  
**Solution:**
```python
# Increase thresholds or reduce max picks
filter = GoldenBetsFilter()
filter.confidence_threshold = 0.90
filter.max_picks = 2
```

### Scenario 3: Low Ensemble Agreement

**Cause:** Models disagree on predictions  
**Action:** Review model training data consistency

## Integration with Your App

### Daily Golden Bets Workflow

```python
import schedule
import time
from datetime import datetime

def fetch_daily_golden_bets():
    """Fetch Golden Bets for today's matches"""
    
    # 1. Get today's fixtures from your app
    matches = get_todays_fixtures()
    
    # 2. Get Smart Bets predictions
    predictor = SmartBetsPredictor()
    smart_predictions = predictor.predict(matches)
    model_probs = predictor.get_model_probabilities(matches)
    
    # 3. Filter for Golden Bets
    filter = GoldenBetsFilter()
    golden_bets = filter.filter_golden_bets(
        smart_bets_predictions=smart_predictions,
        model_probabilities=model_probs
    )
    
    # 4. Send to your app
    send_to_app(golden_bets)
    
    print(f"[{datetime.now()}] Sent {len(golden_bets)} Golden Bets")

# Schedule daily at 9 AM
schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(fetch_daily_golden_bets)

while True:
    schedule.run_pending()
    time.sleep(60)
```

## Performance Tracking

Monitor Golden Bets performance:

```python
def track_golden_bets_performance(golden_bets, results):
    """Track win rate and accuracy"""
    
    total = len(golden_bets)
    wins = sum(1 for bet, result in zip(golden_bets, results) if result == 'win')
    
    win_rate = wins / total if total > 0 else 0
    avg_confidence = sum(bet['confidence_score'] for bet in golden_bets) / total
    avg_agreement = sum(bet['ensemble_agreement'] for bet in golden_bets) / total
    
    print(f"Golden Bets Performance:")
    print(f"  Win Rate: {win_rate:.1%} (Target: ≥85%)")
    print(f"  Avg Confidence: {avg_confidence:.1%}")
    print(f"  Avg Agreement: {avg_agreement:.1%}")
    print(f"  Total Picks: {total}")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Import Errors

```bash
# Ensure all dependencies installed
pip install -r golden-bets-ai/requirements.txt
pip install -r smart-bets-ai/requirements.txt
```

### No Model Probabilities

```python
# Golden Bets works without ensemble agreement
golden_bets = filter.filter_golden_bets(
    smart_bets_predictions=smart_predictions
    # model_probabilities not required
)
```

### API Connection Issues

```bash
# Check API is running
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predictions/golden-bets/config
```
